        <h2>Note from the author</h2>
        <p>It have been a long time since I last touched Windows development, and back then my
        primary programming language was Visual Basic.net. This project have been fun, but it
        turned out to be very taxing on me as my Windows development techniques was fairly rusty
        at best. I have definitely made mistakes, please check my code for errors and contribute
        patches to improve it. Thanks.</p>
